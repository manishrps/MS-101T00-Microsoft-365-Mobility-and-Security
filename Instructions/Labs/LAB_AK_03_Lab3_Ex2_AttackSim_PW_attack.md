# Module 3 - Lab 3 - Exercise 2 - Conduct a Drive-by URL attack using Attack Simulation training

Holly Dickson is concerned that some users at Adatum may require education about selecting URL links to familiar websites that are either fake or have been hacked. This type of attack is known by multiple names, such as a Drive-by URL attack or a watering hole attack. With this type of attack, a targe receives an email containing a URL link, and when the target selects the link, they are taken to a website that runs background code whose sole purpose is to gather information about the target or deploy arbitrary code to their device. As part of her pilot project, Holly has decided to use the Microsoft 365 Attack simulation training feature to determine her users' susceptibility to Drive-by URL attacks.

**Note:** At the end of this exercise, you will disable MFA for Holly's account. This will save you from having to enter the second form of authentication when signing in as Holly in any of the remaining labs in this course.


### Task 1: Configure and launch a Drive-by URL attack 

In a Drive-by URL attack, the website attempting to lure the target will typically be a well-known website that has been compromised in some fashion, or a clone of a well-known web-site itself. This familiarity with the website builds trust in the target that it's safe to select the URL link. Holly wants to create a Drive-by URL attack using a rip-off of the Tailspin Toys website. Tailspin Toys is a nationally known toy store that is constantly offering promotions on TV. Holly wants to use this familiarity with the Tailspin Toys namebrand to offer an enticing promotion for free toys as part of her attack simulation training. This will enable her to see how many Adatum employees will fall for this attack. 

In the prior lab, you created a simulation that was sent to all Adatum users. For this simulation, Holly wants to use Lynne Robbins as her test case before rolling out this attack training company-wide. 

1. You should still be in LON-CL1 and signed in as the **Admin** with a password of **Pa55w.rd**; if not, then sign in now.  

2. After the previous lab exercise, you should still be in the **Microsoft 365 Defender** portal, and you should still be logged in as Holly Dickson; if not, then do so now.

3. In the **Microsoft 365 Defender** portal, you should still be in the **Attack simulation training** page; if not, then in the left-hand navigation pane, under **Email & collaboration**, select **Attack simulation trainng**.

4. On the **Attack Simulation training** page, Holly wants to conduct a **Drive-by URL** attack in which she will use a URL to gather information about the target and Adatum itself.  <br/>

	In the prior lab exercise, you selected an existing payload template (2 Failed Messages). In this lab, you will create a custom payload. On the menu at the top of the page, select **Payloads**. On the **Payloads** tab, select **+ Create a payload**. This initiates a Payload wizard.

5. On the **Select type** page of the Payload wizard, the **Email** option should be selected by default (if not, select it now). Select **Next**. 

6. On the **Select Technique** page, under the **Drive-by URL** option, select the **View details of Drive-by URL** link. This opens a **Drive-by URL** pane on the right. Review the **Description** and the **Simulation steps** for this type of attack. When you're done, close the **Drive-by URL** pane.

7. On the **Select Technique** page, select the **Drive-by URL** attack type and then select **Next**.

8. On the **Payload name** page, enter the following information: <br/>

	- Email payload name: **Free gift offer**

Once everything is correct, select **Submit**. A few moments will pass and you will recieve a confirmation stating **New payload created**. Select **Done**. 

21. On the **Attack simulation training** page, you should still be viewing the **Payloads** tab. Scroll down through the list of payloads to the **Free gift offer** payload that you just created. Review the informmation. Note that no **Compromised rate (%)** has been determined yet, since the payload hasn't been used in simulation. Once you're done, select the **Overview** tab.

11. On the **Assign Training** page, under the **Preferences** section, the **Assign training for me (Recommended)** option should be selected by default (if not, select it now). Select the **Due Date** field. In the drop-down menu that appears, select **7 days after Simulation ends** and then select **Next**.

12. On the **Training landing page**, the **Select the landing page option to be used** field should be prefilled with the **Microsoft landing page** option (if not, select it now). Select the **Preview page** button that appears below this field. 

13. The **Microsoft landing page** appears in the pane on the right. This provides an example of what the landing page will look like when someone experiences a phishing attack. Review the features of this landing page, and then close **Microsoft landing page** pane.

14. On the On the **Training landing page**, note the text that appears in the **Header** and **Body** fields. This is the text that you saw when you previewed the Microsoft landing page. Change the values of these fields to something different, and then select the **Preview page** button again.

### Task 2: Review the Drive-by URL attack results

You will now review the results of the Drive-by URL simulation attack that you just launched.

1. In your browser session where you are logged in as Holly Dickson, you should still be on the **Attack simulator** page. In the **Password Spray Attack** section, it should display **Attack Completed** once the attack is done. Select the **Refresh** icon on the address bar to refresh the results. This may take several minutes to complete, so you may need to refresh your screen several times. Once the attack is complete, select **View Report**.

2. On the **Attack details** page, view the report for the **Password spray test** that you completed. Review the information on the page and note the results after having entered Lynne's actual password among the list of passwords that were entered for the simulation. 

3. In the **Attack details** page, select **Attack simulator** in the navigation thread at the top of the page (**Home > Attack simulator > Report**).

4. Leave your browser open in LON-CL1 and do not close any of the tabs.


### Task 5: Disable Multi-factor Authentication for the Global Admin

To use Microsoft's Attack Simulator to simulate phishing and password attacks, Holly enabled Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for her user account. Now that she has completed the Attack Simulator tests, she wants to disable MFA for her account so that she doesn't have to deal with MFA for the remainder of the pilot project.

1. You should still be logged into **LON-CL1** as the **Admin** account and into Microsoft 365 as Holly Dickson.

2. To disable MFA for Holly Dickson's user account, you must first access the **Active users** list in the Microsoft 365 admin center. If you have the **Microsoft 365 admin center** open in a browser tab, then select that now; otherwise, open a new browser tab, enter **https://portal.office.com** in the address bar, and then on the **Office 365 home** page, select **Admin**. 

3. On the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **Users** and then select **Active users**.

4. In the **Active users** window, on the menu bar at the top of the user list, select **Multi-factor authentication**.

5. In the **multi-factor authentication** window, the **users** tab is displayed by default. Select the check box for **Holly Dickson**, and in Holly's properties pane on the right, select **Disable**.

6. On the **Disable multi-factor authentication?** dialog box, select **yes**. 

7. When the **Updates successful** dialog box appears, select **close**. In the **multi-factor authentication** window, verify Holly's MFA Status has changed to **Disabled**. 

8. You must now sign out of Microsoft 365 as Holly and then sign back in as Holly (without MFA). To do so, perform the following steps: <br/>

	- Close your browser session and all browser tabs (to clear your cache)
	- Open a new Edge browser session
	- Enter the **https://portal.office.com** URL
	- Sign in as **Holly@xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where xxxxxZZZZZZ is the tenant prefix provided by your lab hosting provider) with a password of **Pa55w.rd**
	- From the **Microsoft Office Home** page, select the **Admin** icon to navigate to the **Microsoft 365 admin center**
	
	You are now ready to proceed to the next lab exercise.
